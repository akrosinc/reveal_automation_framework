This project is written in Java and will serve an example of implementing a Selenium test project and Maven. Everything is set up and tests can be added straight away. Used Testrunner is JUnit 5. This project uses page object model design pattern also known as POM, is a design pattern in Selenium that creates an object repository for storing all web elements. It is useful in reducing code duplication and improves test case maintenance.
In Page Object Model, consider each web page of an application as a class file. Each class file will contain only corresponding web page elements. Using these elements, testers can perform operations on the website under test.
